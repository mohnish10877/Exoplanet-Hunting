Are We Alone?
It has been humanityâ€™s most appealing question since the beginning of space exploration. 
We all know how rare life is in the universe despite having studied several systems we have failed to find any signs of life. 
Since the universe is very vast studying all of is nearly impossible, 
therefore the scientists at NASA decided to skim the universe for earth like planets which have a potential for harboring life, 
these are known an exoplanets and a special telescope called Kepler scans the universe and sends the data to NASA, 
In this project we are using the Time Series data from Kepler to analyze the luminescence of these planets and categorize them as exo planets or non-exoplanets.
